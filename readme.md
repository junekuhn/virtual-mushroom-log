# Virtual Mossy Log

This project contains two static sites

### [model-viewing](https://justinkuhn.github.io/three-mold-computer/model-viewing/)

This is a webpage that displays the completed model, complete with textures and lighting

### [mold-simulation](https://justinkuhn.github.io/three-mold-computer/mold-simulation/)

This is a webpage that generates different kinds of mushrooms that can be placed on a log.  Using an L-System, you can generate mushrooms that span from 180 degrees to 360 degrees around.  The color patterns that emerge are a product of the different kinds of branching.  Any mushroom that's created can be exported to a GLTF model.

This project was completed through Computational Form and Process Module
